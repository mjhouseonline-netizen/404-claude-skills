# Affiliate Program Setup

Affiliate marketing scales customer acquisition without upfront costs Ã¢â‚¬â€ you pay only for performance. A well-structured affiliate program can deliver 20-40% of total revenue for digital products and e-commerce brands. This skill covers design, recruitment, and operations.

## Program Structure & Commission Models

**Core components of every affiliate program:**
1. Commission structure (fixed, percentage, tiered)
2. Cookie duration (time between click and purchase attribution)
3. Payment terms (net 30, net 60, monthly)
4. Affiliate materials (banners, copy templates, product data)
5. Support and communication (forum, email, dashboard)

**Commission model comparison:**

**Fixed commission per sale:**
- Example: $25 per customer acquired, regardless of order value
- Pros: Predictable cost, simple for affiliates to understand
- Cons: High-value customers subsidize low-value; misaligned incentives
- Best for: Lead generation, SaaS free trials, fixed-price products
- Typical range: $10-$100 per acquisition depending on product

**Percentage of sale:**
- Example: 15% of order value, or 25% for SaaS recurring revenue
- Pros: Incentivizes high-value sales; scalable with product pricing
- Cons: Low-value customers unprofitable for affiliate to promote
- Best for: E-commerce, variable-priced products, SaaS with varying deal sizes
- Typical range: 5% (commodity e-commerce) to 50% (high-touch SaaS)

**Tiered commission (volume-based):**
- 0-10 sales/month: 10% commission
- 11-50 sales/month: 15% commission
- 51+ sales/month: 20% commission
- Pros: Rewards high-volume affiliates, increases engagement
- Cons: Creates "just below tier" sandbagging (affiliates withhold sales to reset monthly)
- Best for: High-volume affiliate networks, incentive-driven programs
- Structure: Monthly reset recommended; quarterly or annual thresholds for strategic partners

**Hybrid model (most common for high-performing programs):**
- Base: 15% of first-time customer value
- Bonus: Additional 5% if customer stays active 90 days
- Tier bonus: +5% per tier reached (10, 50, 250 sales/quarter)
- Retention bonus: 5% of LTV if customer remains customer for 12+ months
- Pros: Aligns incentives (quality customers, retention)
- Cons: Complex; requires tracking beyond initial sale

## Affiliate Program Tiers

**Not all affiliates are equal Ã¢â‚¬â€ create tier structure to reward excellence:**

**Tier 1: Standard affiliates (entry-level)**
- Commission: Base rate (e.g., 15%)
- Requirements: None (open to anyone)
- Support: Self-service portal, pre-made marketing materials
- Payment: Monthly, net 30
- Engagement: Email updates 1x/month
- Typical volume: <10 sales/month per affiliate
- Use case: Content creators, micro-influencers, SEO bloggers

**Tier 2: Premium affiliates (mid-tier)**
- Commission: Base + 5% bonus if 10+ sales/month
- Requirements: 3+ sales/month for 2 months
- Support: Dedicated affiliate manager contact, custom creative
- Payment: Bi-weekly option available
- Engagement: Monthly check-in calls, monthly content roundup
- Typical volume: 10-100 sales/month per affiliate
- Use case: Niche content networks, software reviewers, course creators

**Tier 3: Partner/Elite affiliates (high-value)**
- Commission: Negotiated (often 20-30%), + performance bonuses
- Requirements: 50+ sales/month, strategic fit
- Support: Executive relationship, co-marketing opportunities
- Payment: Weekly, or custom terms
- Engagement: Quarterly strategic review, co-created campaigns
- Typical volume: 100+ sales/month per affiliate
- Use case: Major publishers, content agencies, strategic partners

**Recruitment targeting by tier:**

**Tier 1 candidates:**
- Bloggers in complementary niches (e.g., productivity software Ã¢â€ â€™ time management blogs)
- Email list owners (newsletters, creators with engaged audiences)
- YouTube creators (unboxing, reviews, tutorials)
- Podcasters (shoutouts between segments)
- Reddit moderators with active communities

**Tier 2 candidates:**
- Content agencies (produce reviews, comparisons for multiple clients)
- Mid-size publishers (10K-100K monthly traffic)
- Industry review sites (G2, Capterra, software directories)
- Affiliate networks (Awin, ShareASale, CJ Affiliate)
- SaaS tool reviewers with established credibility

**Tier 3 candidates:**
- Major publications (Inc, Forbes, TechCrunch verticals)
- Recognized influencers (100K+ followers in target niche)
- Strategic partners (companies serving your target customer)
- Industry associations
- Educational platforms (Udemy, Skillshare, Coursera partners)

## Tracking & Attribution

**Affiliate tracking requires infrastructure:**

**1. Technology stack choices:**

**Self-hosted (full control, highest cost):**
- Platform: Refersion, Tapfiliate, Shrinkle (on your servers)
- Setup: Requires technical knowledge; 2-4 weeks implementation
- Ongoing: Maintain software, backups, security
- Cost: $500-$5K setup, $100-$500/month
- Benefit: Complete data ownership, custom integrations
- Best for: High-volume programs (>$1M/year affiliate revenue)

**Third-party SaaS (easiest, moderate cost):**
- Platforms: Impact, Refersion, LeadDyno, Tapfiliate
- Setup: 1-2 weeks; API integration with your checkout/CRM
- Ongoing: Platform maintains infrastructure
- Cost: $0-$300/month base + commission % (2-10% of affiliate payouts typical)
- Benefit: Quick deployment, automatic payouts, built-in reporting
- Best for: Mid-scale programs (<$1M/year affiliate revenue)

**Affiliate network (largest reach, split economics):**
- Networks: CJ Affiliate, Awin, ShareASale, Impact
- Setup: Network vets and recruits affiliates for you
- Ongoing: You only manage top performers; network handles rest
- Cost: 10-30% of affiliate revenue (on top of affiliate commission)
- Benefit: Instant access to 100K+ affiliates, less recruiting
- Best for: Established brands, e-commerce, scaling quickly

**2. Tracking implementation:**

**Unique affiliate links:**
- Each affiliate gets unique URL: `your-site.com/?aff=unique-id` or `affiliate-id.your-site.com`
- Parameter preserved through checkout: cookie tracking preferred (7-30 day windows)
- Server-side tracking: more accurate (prevents cookie deletion) but requires technical setup

**Conversion tracking checklist:**
- [ ] Affiliate link redirects to your site with tracking parameter
- [ ] Tracking cookie persists through checkout (test with multiple browsers)
- [ ] Sale is recorded with affiliate ID when order completes
- [ ] Conversion value captured (full order value including shipping/tax)
- [ ] Test transaction: affiliate promotes link, you purchase, commission shows 24h later
- [ ] Refund handling: commissions reversed when customer refunds

**3. Fraud prevention:**

**Monitor for suspicious activity:**
- **Self-dealing**: Affiliate is using their own referral link for personal purchases (watch for pattern)
- **Cookie stuffing**: Affiliate injects tracking code without consent (blocks affiliate if caught)
- **Coupon trading**: Affiliate collects coupons, stacks discounts (set coupon-compatibility rules)
- **Click farming**: Fake clicks with no conversion intent (monitor cost-per-acquisition; remove if >5x target)
- **Action**: Review affiliate sources monthly; remove bottom 10% if suspicious patterns emerge

**Fraud detection tools:**
- Built into most platforms: CJ Affiliate, Impact have fraud scoring
- Custom rules: Flag orders with impossible parameters (10 conversions in 1 minute from same IP)
- Affiliate reviews: Spot check top affiliates monthly for legitimacy

## Affiliate Recruitment & Management

**Finding affiliates actively (vs. waiting for inbound):**

**Outreach template (cold email to potential partners):**
```
Subject: Affiliate partnership Ã¢â‚¬â€ [Company name] + [Affiliate niche]

Hi [Name],

I've been following your [blog/podcast/YouTube channel] on [topic] and your audience
clearly values [specific problem your product solves].

We recently launched [product] and think your audience would genuinely benefit from it.
We're building a partner program with:
- [Commission %] commission per sale
- [Payment terms] net payments
- [Marketing materials: pre-written emails, banners, promo codes]

Interested in a quick call to discuss? [Calendar link]

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Why personalization matters:**
- Generic "join our affiliate program" emails get <1% response
- Specific mention of their content/audience gets 10-20% response
- Time investment: 30 seconds per email; 1-3 hours to find and reach out to 100 potential partners

**Recruitment sources:**
- Google Search: "[Product category] review" or "[Competitor name] alternative"
  - Identify top 20 results; affiliate partners are likely there
- Social: Search hashtags, Twitter mentions, YouTube videos about your category
- Existing customers: Ask happy customers if they'd be interested in affiliate commission
- Affiliate networks: Tap into pre-vetted partner bases (CJ, Awin, ShareASale)
- Industry forums: Reddit communities, Slack groups, Discord servers related to your niche

**Onboarding new affiliates (first 30 days):**

**Day 1: Welcome & education**
- Send affiliate kit: program terms, commission structure, cookie duration
- Provide unique tracking link
- Share 3-5 pre-written email templates they can use
- Attach: product images (3-5 sizes), logo, brand guidelines
- Ask: How do they plan to promote? (email, blog, video, social?)

**Day 3: Provide assets**
- Blog content ideas: "Top 3 features," "Use cases," "Comparison vs. competitor"
- Email swipes: 3 promotional email templates (discount code optional)
- Social media calendar: 10 pre-written posts they can adapt
- Bonus: Provide exclusive offer code for their audience (higher conversion)

**Day 7: Check-in call (for Tier 2+ only)**
- Ask about their promotion plan
- Offer: Help them identify their best audience segment
- Provide: Custom discount code tied to their brand (can differentiate offers)
- Goal: Remove friction; increase motivation to promote

**Day 30: First performance review**
- Celebrate early wins: "Great job! You've driven 5 sales already!"
- Debug low performers: "Let's discuss your promotion strategy. What's working? What's not?"
- Offer support: "We can create custom assets for [their specific audience]"
- Metric: Affiliates with 1+ sale in first month have 60%+ lifetime retention

## Compliance & Contracts

**FTC guidelines (US):**
- All affiliate relationships must be clearly disclosed (no hidden sponsorships)
- Disclosure language: "I earn commission from [Company] for purchases through my link"
- Placement: Visible before audience clicks link, not buried in footer
- Monitoring: Spot-check affiliates' content monthly for proper disclosure
- Penalty for non-compliance: Your company can be fined, not affiliate

**Affiliate agreement (legal document):**
- Include: Commission structure, payment terms, IP rights, fraud prevention, termination clause
- Template: HubSpot free affiliate agreement template (starting point)
- Legal review: Have attorney review before launching (cost: $500-$1,500)
- Enforcement: Include clause for immediate removal if affiliate violates terms

**Contract essentials:**
```
1. Commission terms (fixed, percentage, tiers)
2. Cookie duration (7, 14, 30 days typical)
3. Payment schedule (monthly, net 30 common)
4. Prohibited promotion (no paid search on brand terms, no email list buying)
5. Disclosure requirements (FTC compliance)
6. Termination clause (can remove affiliate with 30 days notice)
7. Fraud prevention (both parties liable for suspicious activity)
8. IP rights (affiliate can't modify creative without permission)
```

## Performance Metrics & Scaling

**Monthly tracking dashboard:**

| Metric | Target | Red flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Active affiliates (promoting) | +10% YoY | No growth |
| Affiliate-sourced revenue | 20-40% of total | Declining % |
| Cost per acquisition (CPA) | 50-70% of customer LTV | >100% LTV |
| Average commission per sale | $[calculated] | Trending down |
| Top 20% affiliates deliver | 80% of affiliate revenue | <60% concentration |
| Affiliate retention rate | >70% YoY | <50% |

**Scaling strategy (by revenue stage):**

**Stage 1: Pre-launch ($0-$50K/month company revenue)**
- Manual recruitment (you personally outreach to 10-20 partners)
- Self-serve tools: Gumroad, Tapfiliate free tier
- Payment: Monthly bank transfers (manual)
- Focus: Find 5-10 quality partners who are genuinely aligned

**Stage 2: Growth ($50K-$500K/month)**
- Semi-automated: Join affiliate network (CJ or Awin) + self-serve tool
- Recruit: Hire part-time affiliate manager (contract)
- Tiers: Implement 2-3 tier structure with performance bonuses
- Payment: Automated monthly payouts through platform
- Target: 50-100 active affiliates, 25-35% of revenue from affiliates

**Stage 3: Scale ($500K+/month)**
- Dedicated platform: Move to Impact, Refersion, or fully self-hosted
- Hiring: Full-time affiliate manager + recruiter
- Structure: Vertical-specific teams (e.g., content affiliates vs. influencers vs. strategic)
- Target: 200-500 active affiliates, 30-40% of revenue from affiliates
- Innovation: Performance bonuses, co-marketing programs, exclusive offers for top partners

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Paying top commission to everyone (kills margin; only top performers deserve it)
- No fraud controls (cookie stuffing and self-dealing cost 5-15% of program revenue)
- Minimal support (affiliates need assets to succeed; you get what you invest in)
- Ignoring top performers (losing your top 20% costs more than 10x your affiliate budget)
- Not measuring LTV (paying commissions on low-value customers ruins unit economics)

This skill transforms affiliate programs from "passive" sideline channels into major revenue engines.
