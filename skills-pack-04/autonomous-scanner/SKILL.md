# Autonomous Scanner

**Version**: 1.0
**Category**: Trading Intelligence
**Status**: Production
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-28

---

## Overview

The Autonomous Scanner is the "opportunity hunter" of the trading system. It runs multiple independent screeners in parallel, filters by current market regime, ranks candidates by alpha signal, and delivers the top 10 opportunities daily.

Unlike passive watchlists, the scanner actively hunts for setups that match the current market environment. In a bull market it weights breakouts and momentum; in a bear market it weights value and short squeezes; in a sideways market it favors mean reversion and options income.

**Key principle**: The scanner is fully autonomous. Run it once daily (market open) and act on top 3-5 candidates. No ongoing monitoring required.

## Scan Pipeline Architecture

### Phase 1: Universe Selection

Define the starting universe of tickers to analyze:

```
DEFAULT UNIVERSES:
  - S&P 500 (500 stocks, most liquid)
  - Russell 1000 (1,000 stocks, good liquidity)
  - User Watchlist (custom tickers from ~/.claude/finance/watchlists.json)
  - Sector Leaders (top 5 by market cap per sector)
  - Macro Pivots (market sensitive: XLY, XLF, GDX, USO, TBT)
  - Options Flow Hotspots (daily unusual activity from options-flow-scanner)

USER SELECTION:
  /scan [--universe S&P500|Russell1000|watchlist|sector|macro|all] [--count 500]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Daily scan: use S&P 500 (balanced)
  - Weekly deep dive: use Russell 1000 (catch mid-cap runners)
  - Sector focus: use Sector Leaders + watchlist
```

### Phase 2: Liquidity Pre-Filter

Eliminate stocks that cannot be traded efficiently:

```
FILTERS:
  - Min ADTV: $1,000,000 (can trade 5K shares without slippage)
  - Min Price: $5.00 (eliminates penny stocks)
  - Max Price: $10,000 (reduces outlier delisted stocks)
  - Delisted Flag: Remove if filing bankruptcy/delisting notice
  - Volume Trend: Reject if vol dropped >50% past 20 days (liquidity dying)

RESULT: Reduce universe to 400-450 tradable stocks (from S&P 500)
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Screener Analysis (Parallel Execution)

Run 8 independent screeners. Each returns ranked list of candidates with signals.

#### Screener 1: CANSLIM Growth
**Pattern**: Investor's Business Daily methodology. Momentum + fundamentals.

```
RULES (in order):
  1. Earnings Growth: EPS growth rate >15% (TTM) vs sector median
  2. Earnings Acceleration: Recent quarter EPS growth > 2-year avg
  3. Sales Growth: Revenue growth >15% (TTM)
  4. Profit Margin: Expanding (recent quarter margin > 5-quarter avg)
  5. Technical: Price near 52-week high (top 25% of range)
  6. RS Strength: RS > sector + market (relative strength > 80%)
  7. Chart Setup: Breaking resistance, cup & handle, or flag
  8. New High: New 52-week high on increasing volume

SCORE CALCULATION:
  canslim_score = (eps_growth * 0.25 + eps_accel * 0.15 + sales * 0.15 +
                   margin * 0.10 + tech * 0.15 + rs * 0.10 + pattern * 0.05 +
                   new_high * 0.05)

RESULTS: Top 30 CANSLIM candidates ranked by composite score
```

**Data Sources**:
- EODHD: get_fundamentals_data (EPS, sales, margins)
- Alpha Vantage: ADX, relative strength

```
RULES:
  1. Sideways Price Action: Base-building (price range narrowing)
  2. Bollinger Band Squeeze: BB width < 20-day historical average
  3. ATR Collapse: ATR(14) < ATR(30) (volatility compressed)
  4. Volume Dry-Up: Volume < 50-day average (low volume base)
  5. Then Breakout: Closes > highest close in last 30 days
  6. Volume Confirmation: Breakout volume > 2x average
  7. Follow-Through: Next day also closes above breakout

VCP_SCORE = (
  base_quality * 0.20 +
  bb_squeeze_pct * 0.20 +
  atr_ratio * 0.20 +
  vol_confirmation * 0.20 +
  follow_through * 0.20
)

RESULTS: Top 20 VCP candidates (setups typically 30-40 days old)
```

**Data Sources**:

- technical-analysis skill: pattern quality

#### Screener 3: Value / Dividend Income
**Pattern**: Undervalued stocks with dividends. Deep value + income.

```
RULES:

  2. Price-to-Book: P/B < 1.0 (below book value)
  3. P/S Multiple: P/S < sector median
  4. Free Cash Flow: FCF > 0, FCF yield > 4%
  5. Dividend Yield: Yield > 3% (or sector median)
  6. Payout Ratio: Div payout < 60% of earnings (sustainable)
  7. Dividend History: 5+ years of no cuts
  8. ROIC: ROIC > cost of capital (value creation)

)

RESULTS: Top 30 undervalued dividend stocks
```

**Data Sources**:

```
RULES:
  1. Recent Earnings: Released in last 5 trading days
  2. Beat/Miss: EPS surprise > 2% (beat) OR < -2% (miss)
  3. Surprise Direction: Beats drift up; large misses drift down
  4. IV Crush Recovery: IV lower than pre-earnings (volatility sold off)
  5. Volume Sustain: Volume > 50-day avg (liquidity supporting drift)
  6. Technical Setup: No major resistance in drift direction
  7. Analyst Revisions: Beats often followed by estimate increases
  8. PEAD Duration: Drift typically lasts 10-40 days post-release

PEAD_SCORE = (

)

CONDITIONS:
  - Beats Ã¢â€ â€™ bullish bias (candidates for longs)
  - Misses Ã¢â€ â€™ bearish bias (candidates for shorts or avoid)
  - Max age: 40 days post-release (drift expires)

RESULTS: Top 15-20 PEAD candidates (short-term alpha)
```

**Data Sources**:
- EODHD: earnings dates, EPS actuals vs estimates
- earnings-revisions skill: analyst estimate changes

#### Screener 5: Short Squeeze
**Pattern**: High short interest + catalyst = explosive squeeze moves.

```
RULES:
  1. Short Interest: SI > 20% of float (elevated SI)
  2. SI Trend: SI increasing (shorts building conviction in wrong direction)
  3. Days to Cover: DTC > 3 days (shorts can't cover quickly)
  4. Catalyst Window: Earnings, FDA approval, earnings, or technical breakdown
  5. Liquidity: ADTV > $2M (can cover without destroying price)
  6. Price Momentum: Price near breakout point (near resistance)
  7. Call Skew: Calls bid high relative to puts (options anticipate squeeze)
  8. Short Ladder: SI distribution concentrated in few hands

SQUEEZE_SCORE = (
  si_pct * 0.25 +
  si_trend * 0.15 +

#### Screener 6: Insider Cluster Activity
**Pattern**: When multiple insiders buy within same week = high conviction signal.

```
RULES:
  1. Insider Buys: 3+ insider buy transactions in last 5-10 trading days
  2. Buyer Level: Mix of officers/directors (not just employee options)
  3. Buy Price Range: Buys within 10% of each other (buying near same price)
  4. Black-Out Status: Buys NOT during permitted trading windows (opportunistic)
  5. Historical Precedent: Company has history of insider buying before big moves
  6. Volume of Buys: Total insider purchase value > 5x average daily volume
  7. Relative Strength: Company outperforming sector (thesis confirms bias)

INSIDER_SCORE = (
  buy_cluster_density * 0.30 +
  buyer_seniority * 0.25 +
  price_concordance * 0.15 +
  value_magnitude * 0.15 +
  historical_success * 0.15
)

CONVICTION RULE:
  - Officer-level buys highest conviction

```
RULES:
  1. Pattern Type: Cup & handle, wedge, triangle, flag, breakaway gap
  2. Pattern Maturity: Pattern formed over 4-20 weeks (sufficient base building)
  3. Volume Pattern: Volume declining during consolidation, surge on breakout
  4. Pattern Quality: Symmetric (measure move = prior move up), clean formation
  5. Historical Success: This pattern in this stock has worked 70%+ of time
  6. Measured Move: Target = base breakout level + (pattern height)
  7. Risk/Reward: R:R ratio > 1:2 (upside target 2x the stop level)

PATTERN_SCORE = (
  pattern_quality * 0.25 +
  maturity * 0.20 +
  volume_confirmation * 0.20 +
  measured_move_distance * 0.15 +
  rr_ratio * 0.20
)

PATTERN TYPES PRIORITIZED:
  1. Cup & Handle (most reliable)
  2. Ascending Triangle (breakout confirmed)
  3. Wedge (explosive breakout)
  4. Flag/Pennant (quick 15-30% runs)
  5. Breakaway Gap (extended move likely)

RESULTS: Top 25 chart pattern candidates
```

**Data Sources**:
- chart-patterns skill: active patterns, quality scores, targets
- Alpha Vantage: 60-day price history for pattern validation

  2. Open Interest Ratio: Trade size < 5% of OI (not liquidity-driven)
  3. Price Action: Trade executed at/near bid-ask midpoint (not desperate)
  4. Skew Direction: Calls bought = bullish; puts bought = hedging
  5. Expiration: Strategy indicates time horizon (weekly = quick move; quarterly = longer thesis)
  6. Volume Surge: Unusual vol in options > 2x historical avg
  7. IV Percentile: IV percentile at extreme (> 80% = high volatility = buying advantage)

OPTIONS_FLOW_SCORE = (
  block_magnitude * 0.30 +
  skew_direction * 0.25 +
  timing_alignment * 0.15 +
  vol_surge * 0.15 +
  iv_extremity * 0.15
)

DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS:
  - Large call buying at resistance = breakout expected
  - Large put buying near support = smart money hedging (downturn risk)
  - Call/put ratio reversal = market changing opinion

RESULTS: Top 15 options flow anomaly candidates
```

**Data Sources**:
- options-flow-scanner skill: unusual activity, block trades, skew
- EODHD: options chain, IV, open interest
- technical-analysis: support/resistance, resistance levels

### Phase 4: Regime-Based Filtering & Weighting

Market regime determines which screeners to prioritize:

```
REGIME DETECTION:
  Call macro-regime-detector() to determine current regime:
    - BULL: Market up >2% YoY, VIX < 20, advancing stocks > declining
    - BEAR: Market down >10%, VIX > 25, more decliners than advancers
    - SIDEWAYS: Range-bound, VIX 15-25, equal advancers/decliners
    - VOLATILE: VIX > 30 regardless of direction
```

#### Bull Market Regime

```

POSITION SIZING ADJUSTMENT:
  - Maximum position: 1% (half normal size)
  - Require 2+ signals agreeing before entry
  - Avoid shorting (short squeezes likely in high volatility)
  - Prefer defensive sectors (utilities, staples, healthcare)
```

### Phase 5: Alpha Signal Aggregation (Top Candidates)

For top 30 candidates across all screeners:

```
1. De-duplicate (if stock appears in multiple screeners, keep highest score)
2. Call alpha-signal-aggregator(TICKER) for each
3. Rank by composite alpha score
4. Filter out any scores < +30 (neutral or below = skip)
5. Result: Top 10-15 candidates by alpha score
```

REGIME: BULL (VIX=16, Advancers > Decliners, Fed Neutral)
RECOMMENDATION: Rotate into top 3-5. Scale in on dips to Entry level.
WATCHLIST: Add all 10 to "scanner-picks" for continued monitoring.
```

---

### Phase 7: Auto-Watchlist Management

```
1. Create/update "scanner-picks" watchlist in ~/.claude/finance/watchlists.json
2. Add top 10 candidates with:
   - Entry price (current or nearest support)
   - Target price
   - Stop loss level
   - Alpha score
   - Screeners that matched
   - Date added

3. Auto-expire old candidates:
   - If price hits target Ã¢â€ â€™ remove (thesis complete)
   - If price hits stop Ã¢â€ â€™ remove (thesis broken)
   - If in watchlist > 20 days without move Ã¢â€ â€™ alert user
   - If alpha score decays below +30 Ã¢â€ â€™ remove from active list

4. Track Success Rate:

## Rules & Constraints

### Scanner Rules

1. **Liquidity Requirement**: Only scan stocks with ADTV > $1M. Illiquid stocks rejected.
2. **Penny Stock Filter**: Minimum price $5. Penny stocks (< $5) filtered out automatically.
3. **Delisted Exclusion**: If stock has bankruptcy filing or delisting notice, exclude.
4. **Single Signal Acceptance**: A stock only needs to match ONE screener to qualify. Multiple screener hits boost alpha score but aren't required.
5. **Alpha Threshold**: Final alpha score must be Ã¢â€°Â¥ +30 to appear in top 10. Neutral scores excluded.
6. **Regime Weighting**: Screener weights adapt to market regime (bull, bear, sideways, volatile). No regime = use balanced default weights.
7. **Data Freshness**: Technical data <1 day, fundamental data <90 days. Skip if data stale.
8. **Duplicate Handling**: If stock appears in multiple screeners, consolidate into single entry with highest alpha score.

### Risk Guardrails

1. **Max Positions**: Do not recommend more than 12 positions. If screeners generate >12 top candidates, rank by alpha and show top 12.
2. **Sector Concentration**: If any single sector > 60% of top 10, flag warning. Recommend diversification.
3. **Volatility Adjustment**: In high volatility (VIX > 30), reduce position sizes by 50%. Require 2+ signal agreement.
4. **Short Squeeze Risk**: Short squeeze candidates marked as "HIGH RISK". Max position size 1% (vs 3% for normal picks). Require explicit user approval.
5. **Earnings Catalyst Risk**: PEAD candidates only valid within 40 days of earnings. Auto-expire after 40 days.
