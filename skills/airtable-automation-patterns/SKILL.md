# Airtable Automation Patterns

## Overview
Airtable combines spreadsheet UX with database power. This guide covers native automations, scripting, webhook integrations, and interface design for automated workflows.

## Airtable Automation Basics

### Automation Components

**Three parts to every automation**:
1. **Trigger**: When something happens
2. **Conditions**: Optional filters
3. **Actions**: What to do

**Available Triggers**:
- When record matches conditions
- When record is created/modified
- When a button is clicked
- When webhook is received
- On a schedule

### Pattern 1: Auto-Update Status Based on Time

**Example**: Mark "Overdue" if due date passed

**Trigger**: When record matches conditions
```
Table: Tasks
Condition: Due Date < today() AND Status != "Done"
```

**Action**: Update record
```
Field: Status
Value: Overdue
```

**Additional action**: Send notification
```
Send to: Person (Assigned To field)
Subject: "Task {{ Name }} is overdue"
```

### Pattern 2: Record Created Ã¢â€ â€™ Multi-Step Actions

**Trigger**: When record is created in "Leads"

**Actions** (execute in sequence):
1. Update record
   - Status = "New"
   - Date Received = today()
2. Send email to sales manager
   ```
   Subject: "New lead: {{ Name }}"
   Body: "Company: {{ Company }}"
   ```
3. Create linked record in "Opportunities" table
   - Link = current record
   - Value = 0

## Field & Formula Automation

### Pattern 1: Lookup Fields for Data Enrichment

**Airtable Lookup**: Fetch related data from linked record

**Example**: Leads linked to Companies
```
Table: Leads
- Name
- Company (linked to Companies table)

Table: Companies
- Name
- Industry
- Website
- Funding Stage

Leads with Lookup:
- Name
- Company (link field)
- Company Industry (lookup: Company Ã¢â€ â€™ Industry)
- Company Website (lookup: Company Ã¢â€ â€™ Website)
```

**In automation**: Reference lookup fields for conditions
```
Trigger: Record matches conditions
  Company Industry = "Technology" AND Company Funding Stage = "Series A"

Action: Send email to venture team
```

### Pattern 2: Formula Fields for Calculation

**Example: Days Since Created**
```
DATETIME_DIFF(NOW(), {Created}, 'days')
```

**Example: Commission Calculation**
```
IF({Status} = "Closed", {Deal Value} * 0.1, 0)
```

**Use in automation**:
```
Trigger: When formula value changes
  Commission Amount > 1000

Action: Create record in "High-Value Deals"
```

### Pattern 3: Rollup Fields for Aggregation

**Aggregate data from linked records**

**Example**: Sum of all opportunities for a customer
```
Table: Customers
  - Name
  - Opportunities (link field)

Rollup field: "Total Pipeline"
  - Link field: Opportunities
  - Aggregation function: SUM({Deal Value})
```

**Use in automation**:
```
Trigger: When rollup value changes
  Total Pipeline > $100,000

Action: Move to "VIP" view
Action: Send alert to account manager
```

## Airtable Scripting

### Pattern 1: Custom Automation with Script Block

**Use Airtable's JavaScript runtime for complex logic**

**Example: Bulk email generator**
```javascript
const outputTable = base.getTable("Email Output");
const inputTable = base.getTable("Leads");

const records = await inputTable.selectRecordsAsync();

for (let record of records.records) {
  const name = record.getCellValue("Name");
  const email = record.getCellValue("Email");
  const company = record.getCellValue("Company");

  // Generate personalized email
  const emailBody = `Hi ${name},

I noticed ${company} is in our target market.
Would you be open to a brief conversation about how we help companies like yours?

Best regards`;

  // Create output record
  await outputTable.createRecordAsync({
    "Recipient": [{ id: record.id }],
    "Email Body": emailBody,
    "Status": "Ready to Send"
  });
}

output.markdown("Generated " + records.records.length + " emails");
```

### Pattern 2: Data Validation & Cleanup

**Script: Validate records before processing**

```javascript
const table = base.getTable("Contacts");
const records = await table.selectRecordsAsync();

let errors = [];
let cleaned = 0;

for (let record of records.records) {
  const email = record.getCellValue("Email");
  const name = record.getCellValue("Name");

  // Validate email format
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
    errors.push(`Invalid email: ${record.id}`);
  }

  // Trim whitespace from name
  if (name && name.trim() !== name) {
    await table.updateRecordAsync(record.id, {
      "Name": name.trim()
    });
    cleaned++;
  }
}

output.markdown(`Cleaned: ${cleaned}, Errors: ${errors.length}`);
if (errors.length > 0) {
  output.markdown("**Errors**: " + errors.join(", "));
}
```

### Pattern 3: Integration Script - Send to External API

**Script: Process records and send to CRM**

```javascript
const table = base.getTable("New Leads");
const view = table.getView("Unsynced");
const records = await view.selectRecordsAsync();

const API_KEY = process.env.SALESFORCE_API_KEY;
const salesforceUrl = "https://instance.salesforce.com/services/data/v57.0/sobjects/Lead";

for (let record of records.records) {
  const name = record.getCellValue("Name");
  const email = record.getCellValue("Email");
  const company = record.getCellValue("Company");

  try {
    // Call Salesforce API
    const response = await fetch(salesforceUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        "FirstName": name.split(" ")[0],
        "LastName": name.split(" ")[1] || "",
        "Email": email,
        "Company": company
      })
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    // Update Airtable with Salesforce ID
    await table.updateRecordAsync(record.id, {
      "Salesforce ID": result.id,
      "Sync Status": "Synced"
    });

  } catch (error) {
    output.markdown(`Error syncing ${name}: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

output.markdown("Sync complete");
```

## Webhook Integration

### Pattern 1: Receive Webhook Ã¢â€ â€™ Create Records

**Scenario**: External form submission Ã¢â€ â€™ Create Airtable record

**Setup**:
1. Airtable Ã¢â€ â€™ Automations Ã¢â€ â€™ New automation
2. Trigger: "When webhook is received"
3. n8n generates webhook URL
4. External form (Typeform, Google Forms) sends data to this URL
5. Airtable receives webhook and creates record

**Webhook Payload** (expected format):
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "interest": "Product Demo"
}
```

**Airtable Action**:
```
Table: Leads
Create record with:
  Name: {{ payload.name }}
  Email: {{ payload.email }}
  Company: {{ payload.company }}
  Interest: {{ payload.interest }}
  Date Received: today()
```

### Pattern 2: Record Change Ã¢â€ â€™ Send Webhook

**Scenario**: Airtable record updated Ã¢â€ â€™ Notify external system

**Setup**:
1. Trigger: When record is updated
2. Condition: Status changed to "Approved"
3. Action: Send webhook to external URL

**Webhook sent** (by Airtable):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "recordId": "rec123",
  "record": {
    "Name": "Project Alpha",
    "Status": "Approved",
    "Budget": 50000
  }
}
```

**External receiver** (n8n, Zapier):
- Receive webhook
- Update project management system
- Create task
- Send Slack notification

## Airtable Interfaces

### Pattern 1: Auto-Populate Interface Based on Filters

**Create interface with dynamic content**

**Example**: Sales dashboard interface
```
Layout:
Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Filters section
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Date range picker
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Rep dropdown (shows names from Reps table)
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬ Status multi-select
Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Summary cards
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Total pipeline (formula based on filters)
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬ Closed deals count
Ã¢â€â€š  Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬ Win rate percentage
Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬ Deals table (filtered by above selections)
```

**Configuration**:
1. Add table widget: "Opportunities"
2. Apply filter: Rep = {{ filter.selectedRep }}
3. Apply filter: Status != "Lost"
4. Summary cards: Use rollup fields with filtered data

### Pattern 2: Button-Triggered Actions in Interface

**Interface button: Click Ã¢â€ â€™ Automation executes**

**Example**: "Move to Won" button
```
Button properties:
  - Label: "Mark as Won"
  - Icon: checkmark
  - Color: green
  - Visible when: Status != "Won"

Action on click:
  - Update Status = "Won"
  - Update Closed Date = today()
  - Create row in "Won Deals" table
  - Send Slack notification
```

## Advanced Automation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Conditional Multi-Branch

**Complex routing based on multiple factors**

```
Trigger: Record created in "Opportunities"

Branch 1: IF (Value > $100,000) AND (Rep.Years = new):
  Action: Assign to team lead for review
  Action: Send alert to manager

Branch 2: ELSE IF (Value > $50,000):
  Action: Auto-assign to senior rep
  Action: Create task: "Send proposal"

Branch 3: ELSE:
  Action: Auto-assign to junior rep
  Action: Create task: "Send intro email"
```

**Airtable Setup**:
- Use multiple automations (one per branch)
- Each has own trigger + conditions + actions
- Or use script block for all logic in one place

### Pattern 2: Scheduled Batch Processing

**Automation on schedule: Daily, weekly, monthly**

**Trigger**: "Run automation on a schedule"
```
Frequency: Daily at 9 AM
```

**Actions**:
```
1. Query records matching condition
   (Status = "Pending" AND Days Outstanding > 30)

2. For each record:
   a. Create follow-up task
   b. Send email reminder
   c. Update Last Follow-up date

3. Generate report
   - Count of overdue items
   - Send to manager via email
```

### Pattern 3: Approval Workflow

**Multi-stage approval using linked records**

**Tables**:
- "Requests" (main table)
- "Approvals" (linked, tracks approvers)

**Workflow**:
```
Step 1: Record created in Requests
  Create linked Approval record
  Status = "Pending Manager"
  Assignee = Request creator's manager

Step 2: Manager updates Approval status = "Approved"
  Create another Approval record
  Status = "Pending Finance"
  Assignee = Finance team lead

Step 3: Finance approves
  Update Request status = "Approved"
  Send notification to requester
  Create follow-up task

Step 4: If Finance rejects
  Update Request status = "Rejected"
  Notify requester with reason
  Clear scheduled follow-ups
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Zapier Airtable Automations

**Use Zapier for complex integrations Airtable can't do**

```
Trigger: Airtable record created
  (via Zapier)

Actions (in Zapier):
1. Look up company in Clearbit for enrichment
2. Create contact in HubSpot
3. Add to email nurture sequence
4. Create task in Asana
5. Update Airtable with external IDs
6. Send Slack notification
```

### Pattern 2: API-Based Sync

**Keep Airtable in sync with external system**

```
Airtable (table: Sales Contacts)
  Ã¢â€ â€ HubSpot (Contacts)
  Ã¢â€ â€ Salesforce (Leads)

Sync logic:
- New contact in Airtable Ã¢â€ â€™ Create in HubSpot + Salesforce
- Update in HubSpot Ã¢â€ â€™ Update Airtable
- Delete in Salesforce Ã¢â€ â€™ Archive in Airtable
```

**Implementation** (using n8n):
1. Webhook from Airtable automation
2. Determine action type (create/update/delete)
3. Call appropriate CRM APIs
4. Update Airtable with external IDs
5. Log to audit table

## Best Practices

1. **Use formula fields for derived data** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Don't store calculated values
2. **Link tables instead of duplicating data** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Maintain single source of truth
3. **Create views for different workflows** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Each role sees relevant data
4. **Test automations with sample records** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Before enabling
5. **Document automation logic** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Add descriptions to automations
6. **Monitor failed automations** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Check audit log regularly
7. **Use scripts for one-time data fixes** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Don't rely on automations for cleanup
8. **Backup critical data** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Export important tables monthly
9. **Limit webhook frequency** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Prevent cascading failures
10. **Use interfaces for non-technical users** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Hide complexity
