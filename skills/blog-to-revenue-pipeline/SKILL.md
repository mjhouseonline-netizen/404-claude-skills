## Stage 2: Email List Building

### Converting Readers into Subscribers

```yaml
Email Capture Strategy:

Lead Magnet Placement:
  1. Homepage Hero
     - Sticky bar or above-fold form
     - "Get the [free resource] Ã¢â€ â€™"
     - Conversion target: 5-10%

  2. Blog Sidebar
     - CTA after first paragraph
     - "Subscribe to new posts"
     - Conversion target: 3-5%

  3. Exit Intent Pop-up
     - Shows when user tries to leave
     - "Before you go: Get [resource]"
     - Conversion target: 10-20%

  4. Content Footer
     - After blog post content
     - "Join [number] subscribers"
     - Conversion target: 2-5%

  5. Lead Magnet Landing Page
     - Dedicated page for specific resource
     - Full-page form (1 field: email)
     - Conversion target: 30-50%

Conversion Math:
  - Blog traffic: 1,000 monthly visitors
  - Homepage signup: 1,000 Ãƒâ€” 5% = 50 subscribers
  - Sidebar signup: 800 Ãƒâ€” 3% = 24 subscribers
  - Exit intent: 200 Ãƒâ€” 15% = 30 subscribers
  - Content footer: 500 Ãƒâ€” 3% = 15 subscribers
  - Total: ~120 subscribers/month from 1,000 visitors

Growth Target:
  - Month 1: 50 subscribers

  - Month 6: 400 subscribers
  - Month 12: 1,000+ subscribers
