### Custom Categories (By Industry)
**E-commerce**: Inventory, shipping, returns processing
**SaaS**: Cloud infrastructure, customer support, onboarding
**Services**: Subcontractors, equipment, licensing
**Real Estate**: Mortgage, maintenance, property taxes

## Accrual vs Cash Basis

### Cash Basis
- **Recognition**: Income when cash received, expenses when cash paid
- **Example**:
  - Invoice customer in Dec, payment received Jan Ã¢â€ â€™ Recognize revenue in Jan
  - Bill received in Dec, paid in Jan Ã¢â€ â€™ Recognize expense in Jan
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, reconciles with bank statement
- **For**: Very small businesses, service providers
- **IRS rule**: Can use if < $25M annual revenue (pass-through entities, most small businesses)

### Accrual Basis
- **Recognition**: Income when earned, expenses when incurred
- **Example**:
  - Invoice in Dec, payment in Jan Ã¢â€ â€™ Recognize revenue in Dec
  - Bill received in Dec, paid in Jan Ã¢â€ â€™ Recognize expense in Dec
- **Accuracy**: Better reflects business performance in specific period
- **For**: Growing businesses, manufacturing, multi-period contracts
- **Inventory**: Required if > $25M revenue or manufacturing

### Hybrid Approach
- **Revenue**: Accrual (recognize when sold/invoiced)
- **Expenses**: Cash (recognize when paid)
- **Common for service businesses**: SaaS, consulting, freelance

### Accrual Journal Entries

**Invoice issued (revenue accrual)**:
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable 1110     $1,000
   Cr. Product Sales 4010                  $1,000
Description: Customer ABC invoice #12345
```

**Cash received later**:
```
Dr. Cash 1010                    $1,000
   Cr. Accounts Receivable 1110           $1,000
Description: Payment from Customer ABC
```

**Bill received (expense accrual)**:
```
Dr. Supplies Expense 6110        $500
   Cr. Accounts Payable 2010              $500
Description: Office supplies invoice #99
```

**Bill paid later**:
```
Dr. Accounts Payable 2010        $500
   Cr. Cash 1010                         $500
Description: Payment for invoice #99
```

## Bank Reconciliation

### Monthly Process (Essential)
1. **Gather statements**: Bank statement + credit card statements
2. **List transactions**: In accounting software, confirm all posted
3. **Identify discrepancies**: Outstanding checks, pending deposits
4. **Adjust as needed**: Mark cleared items, reconcile differences
5. **Investigate**: Any unexplained differences

### Reconciliation Worksheet
```
Bank statement balance:          $10,500
Add: Deposits in transit
  Deposit 5/31 from customer XYZ   $2,000
                                  $12,500

Less: Outstanding checks
  Check #1023 to supplier            $300
  Check #1024 to contractor          $800
                                    ($1,100)

Reconciled bank balance:         $11,400

Accounting system balance:       $11,400 Ã¢Å“â€œ Match!
```

### Common Reconciliation Issues
- **Timing**: Check clears 2-3 days after written
- **Fees**: Bank charges fees not in accounting software yet
- **Interest**: Bank interest earned added to statement
- **Duplicate**: Transaction recorded twice (delete one)
- **Reversal**: ACH payment reversed (refund must clear)

### Software Automation
- Most accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) auto-matches transactions
- Bank connectivity via Plaid API
- Manual review still required (10-15 min per account/month)

## Fixed Assets & Depreciation

### Capitalization vs Expensing
- **Capitalize**: Asset with life > 1 year and cost > $2,500 (IRS Section 179)
- **Expense**: Supplies, software under $2,500, short-term costs

### Depreciation Methods

**Straight-line** (most common):
- Formula: (Cost - Salvage Value) ÃƒÂ· Useful Life
- Example: Laptop $1,500, useful life 5 years
- Annual depreciation: $1,500 ÃƒÂ· 5 = $300/year

**Accelerated (MACRS)**:
- Deduct more in early years, less in later years
- IRS schedules by asset class (5-year property, 7-year property, etc)
- Benefits: Higher early deductions, better cash flow

**Units of production**:
- Depreciation based on usage (equipment running hours)
- Formula: (Cost Ãƒâ€” Hours Used This Year) ÃƒÂ· Total Estimated Hours

### Depreciation Journal Entry

   Cr. Equipment 1300                      $1,500

## Monthly Bookkeeping Checklist

- [ ] AR aging (invoices outstanding, follow up on past due)
- [ ] AP aging (bills coming due, plan cash for payments)
- [ ] Payroll processing (if applicable)
- [ ] Quarterly estimated taxes (Jan 15, Apr 15, June 15, Sept 15)
- [ ] Review P&L (compare to budget, identify variances)
- [ ] Check cash balance (enough to cover next 30 days?)

## Common Bookkeeping Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| No reconciliation | Wrong balance, fraud undetected | Reconcile monthly, automate if possible |
| Personal/business mixed | Tax issues, audit risk | Separate bank accounts + clear categorization |
| No invoices recorded | Revenue underreported, cash unclear | Record when issued (accrual), track status |
| Uncategorized expenses | Can't analyze spending, deductions missed | Standardize categories, train team |
| No backup | Data loss in system failure | Cloud backup (automated in QuickBooks, Xero) |

## Getting Help

- **Bookkeeper**: Handles transactions, reconciliation
- **CPA/Accountant**: Tax strategy, financial planning
- **Business accountant**: Non-CPAs who do accounting (cheaper than CPA for bookkeeping-only)
- **Cost estimate**: Bookkeeper $300-600/month, CPA annual tax $1,500-3,000+

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Gross profit margin**: (Revenue - COGS) ÃƒÂ· Revenue
- **Operating margin**: Operating income ÃƒÂ· Revenue
- **Net profit margin**: Net income ÃƒÂ· Revenue
- **Current ratio**: Current assets ÃƒÂ· Current liabilities (liquidity)
- **Debt-to-equity**: Total debt ÃƒÂ· Total equity (leverage)
