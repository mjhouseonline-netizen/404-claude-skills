# CTV Advertising Operations Ã¢â‚¬â€ MNTN Performance TV Skill

## 1. Platform Overview

### CTV vs OTT Terminology
- **Connected TV (CTV)**: The hardware Ã¢â‚¬â€ Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Vizio), streaming devices (Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV), gaming consoles
- **Over-the-Top (OTT)**: The delivery method Ã¢â‚¬â€ content streamed over the internet, bypassing traditional cable/satellite
- Together: CTV advertising = ads served to Smart TV hardware via OTT delivery

### MNTN Differentiators
- **Living Room Quality Inventory**: Strictly premium episodic content (shows like HBO, Netflix originals), non-skippable 15-30s placements
- **Verified Visits Attribution**: Household-level cross-device tracking Ã¢â‚¬â€ viewer sees ad on TV Ã¢â€ â€™ tracks when that household visits your site on ANY device (phone, desktop, tablet)
- **Dynamic CPM Pricing**: dCPM model optimizes bids based on predicted conversion likelihood, not just impression count
- **The Flywheel**: Scale ad spend Ã¢â€ â€™ access better inventory rates Ã¢â€ â€™ improve ROAS Ã¢â€ â€™ justify larger budgets Ã¢â€ â€™ repeat

### MNTN vs Competitors
- Traditional TV: High CPM ($30-60), slow attribution, limited targeting
- Programmatic (The Trade Desk, Roku): Broader inventory (including user-generated content), lower quality guarantee, individual-level tracking
- MNTN: Premium+measured, household-level attribution, AI-powered audience targeting, higher CPM ($15-25) justified by quality

## 2. Pixel Setup & Verification

### Two-Pixel Architecture (BOTH Required)

**Tracking Pixel (Site-wide)**
- Fires on every page of your site
- Initializes household tracking
- Sends site visitor data to MNTN for retargeting audiences
- Status: Must be Active before launching campaigns

**Conversion Pixel (Confirmation Pages Only)**
- Fires only on post-conversion pages (thank you, purchase confirmation, demo booked, whitepaper download)
- Sends conversion events to MNTN for attribution and reporting
- Key events: purchase, lead, app install, content download

### Installation Methods (Priority Order)

1. **Google Tag Manager (Preferred)**
   - Create Custom HTML tag with MNTN tracking code
   - Trigger: All Pages (Tracking), Specific Pages (Conversion)
   - No vendor script required, works cross-domain

2. **Shopify App**
   - MNTN app available in Shopify Store, one-click install
   - Auto-installs both pixels, no code needed

3. **Adobe Experience Platform Launch**
   - Custom code extension, upload MNTN pixel script
   - Requires Adobe account

4. **Manual HTML**
   - Paste `<script>` directly into page HTML
   - Site-wide in header (Tracking), conversion pages only (Conversion)
   - Last resort if no tag manager available

### Installation Checklist

- [ ] Tracking Pixel Ã¢â€ â€™ site header, all pages, firing on initial page load
- [ ] Conversion Pixel Ã¢â€ â€™ post-conversion page only (thank you/confirmation)
- [ ] CSP (Content Security Policy) whitelisted: `*.mountain.com`
- [ ] No iFrames: Pixels must fire in parent window context
- [ ] Geographic: US traffic only (MNTN US-only platform)

### Verification in Chrome DevTools

1. Open site in browser, open DevTools (F12 Ã¢â€ â€™ Network tab)
2. Filter requests: type `mountain` in search box
3. Look for two request patterns:
   - `spx?dxver=` (Tracking Pixel)
   - `st?ga_tracking_id=` (Conversion Pixel on conversion page)
4. Both should show 200 status, fired within 1s of page load

### Pixel Status Tracking

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Active | Firing correctly, ready to use | None |
| Pending Review | MNTN reviewing, typically 24-48 hrs | Wait, check dashboard daily |
| Not Installed | Not detected on site | Re-install, verify CSP, test in DevTools |
| Deprecated | Old pixel, phased out | Use new pixel ID |

---

## 3. Audience Strategy

### Prospecting vs Retargeting (Immutable at Creation)

**Prospecting Audiences**
- New users who haven't visited your site before
- Goal: Build awareness among cold audience
- Audience types: MNTN Matched, Interest-Based, Location
- Attribution window: 14 days default
- Budget: Typically higher (more inventory available)

**Retargeting Audiences**
- Users who have visited your site (tracked by Tracking Pixel)
- Goal: Convert warm leads, reduce bounce
- Minimum households: 1,000 unique visitors with pixel data
- Attribution window: 7 days default
- Budget: Lower CPM, higher conversion rate
- **CRITICAL**: Cannot switch from Prospecting Ã¢â€ â€™ Retargeting after campaign creation. Plan upfront.

### Audience Types Detail

#### MNTN Matched (AI-Powered, Prospecting Only)
- Seed keyword phrases Ã¢â€ â€™ MNTN AI identifies 99% of US households matching intent
- 3 Intensity Levels (cumulative):
  - **High**: Core audience (strictest match)
  - **Medium**: High + adjacent interests (~2x reach)
  - **Maximum**: Medium + lookalikes (~4x reach, lower quality)
- Best for: Scale, brand awareness
- Avoid: Too broad without location filter

#### Interest-Based (3rd Party, Prospecting Only)
- Sourced from LiveRamp data partnerships
- Pre-built categories: Home/Garden, Auto, Finance, Health, etc.
- Stacking rule: Use AND logic only (all must match), avoid OR logic
- Don't mix: Demographics alone perform poorly; combine with intent
- Typical stack: Interest A AND Interest B AND NOT Excluded Interest

#### Site Visitor Segments (Retargeting Only)
- Based on Tracking Pixel data
- Sub-segments available:
  - **All Visitors**: Anyone who hit any page
  - **Specific Pages**: Filter by URL pattern (e.g., `/pricing`)
  - **2+ Pages**: More engaged (filtered segment)
  - **Cart Abandoners**: /cart or /checkout visited, no conversion (7-14d window)
  - **Past Purchasers**: Converted within 30-90d window
- Minimum: 1,000 households to activate

#### CRM Audiences (Prospect or Retarget)
- Upload: Email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses
- Format: Hashed (SHA256) or plaintext (MNTN hashes server-side)
- Minimum records: 1,000
- Processing time: Up to 10 business days
- Match rate: Typically 60-75% of uploaded records matched to households

### Location Targeting

- **National**: Recommended (all US), best inventory access
- **Regional**: States, DMAs (Designated Market Areas), ZIPs, cities available
- **Stacking rule**: All location filters use AND logic (must match ALL)
- **Minimum geo audience**: 50,000+ households (smaller targets may throttle)

## 4. Creative Management

### Video Specifications (EXACT)

**Format Requirements**
- Resolution: 1920x1080p minimum (16:9 aspect ratio required)
- Duration: Exactly 15 seconds OR exactly 30 seconds (no 6s, no 45s)
- File types: .mp4 or .mov
- Maximum file size: 4GB
- Frame rate: Constant (23.98 fps, 25 fps, or 29.97 fps ONLY; no variable frame rate)
- Bitrate: 15-30 MBPS
- Codec: H.264 video, AAC audio
- Audio: Required (never silent), stereo or mono

**Creative Development**
- Open rate (non-skippable): Designed as "native" to content
- Call-to-action: Text overlay or voiceover in final 3-5 seconds
- Branding: Logo placement top-right or bottom-right, 10% of screen minimum
- Color grading: Match OTT platform's color space (broadcast-safe recommended)

### Multi-Touch Creative (Display + Video Combo)

**Activation Rule**: Decide at campaign creation Ã¢â‚¬â€ immutable after launch

**Requirements**
- Minimum 3 sizes (300x250 required), up to 6 recommended
- Each file: Static image .jpg/.png or animated .gif, max 200KB
- Aspect ratios: 300x250, 728x90, 160x600, 320x50, 970x250, 320x480
- Refresh: Different creative serves on each new device visit (prevents ad fatigue)

**Best Practice Stack** (6 sizes)
1. 300x250 (Medium Rectangle) Ã¢â‚¬â€ anchors desktop engagement
2. 728x90 (Leaderboard) Ã¢â‚¬â€ top-of-page, high-visibility
3. 970x250 (Billboard) Ã¢â‚¬â€ large desktop, premium
4. 160x600 (Wide Skyscraper) Ã¢â‚¬â€ sidebar anchor
5. 320x50 (Mobile Banner) Ã¢â‚¬â€ mobile-first
6. 320x480 (Mobile Interstitial) Ã¢â‚¬â€ mobile full-width

### Common Rejection Reasons & Fixes

| Rejection | Cause | Fix |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Broken frames | Corrupted video data | Re-export from source file |
| Missing audio | Silent video submitted | Add voiceover or music track |
| Variable frame rate | Mixed fps during edit | Force constant 29.97fps in export settings |
| Wrong duration | 16s or 29s submitted | Re-trim to exactly 15s or 30s |
| Bitrate out of range | <15 or >30 MBPS | Adjust encoder settings in export |
| Low resolution | 1280x720 or less | Re-render at 1920x1080 minimum |

### Creative Refresh Strategy

- **Evergreen campaigns**: Rotate creative every 2-3 months (avoid ad fatigue on long-running awareness)
- **Seasonal campaigns**: Rotate every 10-20 days (fresh creative improves click-through on limited window)
- **A/B testing**: 2-3 creative variants, compare CTR/Conversion Rate after 2 weeks, pause underperformers
- **Frequency cap recommendation**: 3-5 impressions per household per week

### Creative-as-a-Service (CaaS)

- **QuickFrame partnership**: MNTN partner provides rapid video production
- **Requirements**: Minimum annual spend commitment (typically $50K-100K)
- **Turnaround**: 5-7 business days per video
- **Pricing**: Typically $2,000-5,000 per video depending on complexity

---

## 5. Campaign Launch

### Immutable Objectives (Select Once)

- **Awareness**: Drive brand recognition, no conversion tracking required
- **Sales**: E-commerce transactions, requires conversion pixel on purchase confirmation
- **Traffic**: Drive website visits, conversion pixel on any landing page
- **Leads**: Form submissions, phone calls, requires conversion pixel on thank-you page
- **App Promotion**: Mobile app installs, requires app event tracking

**Goal** (changeable post-launch): CPV, CPCV, CPA, ROAS

### Budget Types

**Monthly Budget**
- Fixed daily spend rate (Budget ÃƒÂ· days of month)
- Auto-resets on 1st of next month
- No rollover Ã¢â‚¬â€ unused daily budget is lost
- Best for: Ongoing awareness, consistent brand presence

**Flighted Budget**
- Custom date range: minimum 3 days, maximum as needed
- Spend concentrated in date range only
- Best for: Seasonal campaigns, product launches, event-based promotions

### Pre-Launch Verification Checklist

- [ ] Tracking Pixel: Active status, verified in DevTools
- [ ] Conversion Pixel: Active status (if Sales/Leads/Traffic objective)
- [ ] Email verified: Login email confirmed in MNTN account
- [ ] Logo uploaded: Brand logo added to account (used in platform UI)
- [ ] Creative approved: All videos/display ads cleared by MNTN review (24-48 hrs)
- [ ] Audience applied: Prospecting type selected AND size showing (min 1M households)
- [ ] Budget allocated: Monthly or Flighted budget set, minimum $500/day recommended
- [ ] Billing method: Credit card on file, verified

### Launch Workflow

1. **Campaign Setup**
   - Name: Use consistent naming (Brand-Objective-Month, e.g., "Acme-Sales-Mar2026")
   - Objective & Goal (immutable): Select carefully
   - Budget type: Monthly or Flighted

2. **Audience Configuration**
   - Prospecting or Retargeting (immutable)
   - Audience type: MNTN Matched, Interest, Site Visitor, CRM
   - Location filter (AND logic)
   - Frequency cap (optional, default 3-5/week)

3. **Creative Allocation**
   - Video: 15s or 30s, all specs validated
   - Multi-Touch (if enabled): 3-6 display sizes
   - Rotation: Even rotation across creatives

4. **Tracking & Integrations**
   - Conversion pixel: Link to Objective (Sales/Leads/Traffic)
   - UTM parameters: Include utm_source=mntn, utm_medium=ctv in landing URL
   - GA4 integration: Enable for real-time reporting (optional but recommended)

5. **Review & Launch**
   - Double-check all fields
   - Set start date (today or future)
   - Click "Launch Campaign"

### Common Launch Gotchas

**Monthly Budget Timing Issue**
- If campaign launches on day 25 of month, system calculates: (remaining budget) Ãƒâ€” (full month days)
- Result: System attempts to deliver full month's budget in 6 days Ã¢â€ â€™ throttle
- **Fix**: For mid-month launches, use Flighted budget instead, or manually reduce monthly budget

**Missing Conversion Pixel**
- Launching Sales objective without conversion pixel Ã¢â€ â€™ zero conversions tracked
- **Fix**: Verify pixel fires on thank-you page before launch

**Audience Too Broad**
- MNTN Matched on "Maximum" intensity + no location filter Ã¢â€ â€™ massive audience, budget spent inefficiently
- **Fix**: Apply location filter (state or DMA), or use "High" intensity instead

## 7. Reporting & Measurement

### Verified Visits Attribution Model

**Flow**: Household sees CTV ad Ã¢â€ â€™ MNTN records impression + household ID Ã¢â€ â€™ household visits your site within window on any device Ã¢â€ â€™ MNTN matches visit to impression Ã¢â€ â€™ counts as conversion

**Windows** (customizable per campaign)
- **Retargeting**: 7 days default (can extend to 30d)
- **Prospecting**: 14 days default (can extend to 30d)
- **Conversion**: 30 days default (separate from impression window)

**Cross-device tracking**
- Sees ad on Roku Ã¢â€ â€™ visits site on iPhone 3 days later
- MNTN matches iPhone traffic to Roku household ID Ã¢â€ â€™ attributed

---

## 9. Audience Testing Loop (Post-72-Hour)

### The Problem: Cold start
- New campaigns take 72 hours to accumulate impressions and optimize
- First 48 hours: System learning, higher CPM, lower conversion rate
- Hour 48-72: MNTN algorithm starts optimizing targeting
- Hour 72+: Conversion rate stabilizes, CPV drops 15-30%

### Post-72-Hour Audit (Day 4 of Campaign)

**Metrics to Review**
1. Impressions: Target 50K+ by day 3 (indicates healthy pacing)
2. CPV: Should be within 30% of projected (if overperforming, audience is hot)
3. Conversion Rate: Compare day 1-3 vs industry benchmark (2-5% typical)
4. Frequency: Check if households are seeing repeats (indicates audience saturation)
5. Geographic distribution: Is spend distributed across regions or concentrated?

**Decision Framework**

| Metric | Healthy Range | Action If Underperforming |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Impressions | 40K-100K by day 3 | Increase budget 50%, loosen audience targeting |
| CPV | Within 30% of projection | Check audience quality, confirm landing page loads |
| Conversion Rate | 2-5% baseline | Test new landing page, adjust audience intent |
| Frequency | 3-5 per household/week | Reduce frequency cap or pause audience |
| CTR (if tracking clicks) | >0.5% | Creative underperforming, refresh and test new variant |

### Optimization Actions

**High-Performing Audience** (Conversion Rate > 5%, ROAS > 3:1)
- Action: Increase budget 25-50% immediately
- Expand: Loosen intensity (High Ã¢â€ â€™ Medium) to reach adjacent audience
- Test: Clone campaign with different creative, run parallel

**Medium-Performing** (Conversion Rate 2-5%, ROAS 1.5-3:1)
- Action: Maintain budget, optimize creatives
- Test: New video variant (different CTA, hook, or visuals)
- Duration: Let run for 2 full weeks before pause decision

**Underperforming** (Conversion Rate <2%, ROAS <1.5:1)
- Action: Audit landing page (UX, load speed, mobile responsiveness)
- Audience audit: Is targeting too broad? Try High intensity instead of Maximum
- Creative audit: Test new video variant (different angle, hook, CTA timing)
- Location audit: Is spend concentrated in low-ROI region? Add state filter
- Decision timeline: If no improvement by day 14, pause and reallocate budget

### Creative Rotation Testing

**Methodology** (A/B test two creatives)
- Campaign 1: Creative A (15s video)
- Campaign 2: Creative B (15s video)
- Same audience, location, budget
- Run parallel for 14 days
- Compare: CTR, Conversion Rate, CPA
- Winner: Increase to 70-30 split, pause loser

**Refresh Cadence**
- Winning creative: Run for 3-4 months (evergreen)
- Refresh frequency: Every 2 months with new variant
- Test window: 2-week minimum per variant (accumulate 100+ conversions)

---

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Audience is too small" (< 100K households)
- MNTN Matched: Broaden keywords or increase intensity (High Ã¢â€ â€™ Medium Ã¢â€ â€™ Maximum)
- Interest-Based: Add additional interest category (use AND logic)
- Location: Expand from state to region or national
- Solution typically increases reach 2-4x

### "Campaign not delivering" (0 impressions after 6 hours)
- Check: Pixel approval status (Pending Review will block delivery)
- Check: Budget not entered or insufficient credit card
- Check: Landing page down or returning 404 (MNTN validates URLs)
- Check: Audience size showing in UI (if not, audience is empty)
- Fix: Resolve blockers, manually restart campaign delivery

### "Conversion rate dropped 50% overnight"
- Frequency fatigue: Household seeing ad too many times
- Solution: Reduce frequency cap or pause audience segment
- Seasonal: External event affecting conversions (competitor promo, holiday)
- Landing page change: Confirm URL still valid, UX not degraded
- Attribution window: Did you change conversion window? May hide conversions

### "GA4 not showing MNTN traffic"
- UTM parameters: Verify utm_source=mntn appears in GA4 (check acquisition report)
- GA4 integration: Reconnect OAuth in MNTN dashboard
- Delay: MNTN data syncs with 15-min delay; wait 30 min before troubleshooting
- Pixel mismatch: Ensure conversion pixel on thank-you page matches GA4 goal definition
